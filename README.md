# Express-Note-Taker

## Description

As a web developer, it's important that I stay on top of my tasks and reminders by creating notes that I can access later on. Through the use of Express, I've been able to create a note taking app that connects existing HTML documents with a JSON database to allow the user to create notes to themselves.

## Installation

To access the Note Taker, you'll need to clone the repo at the link below:

Click on the Note Title to enter a title for the note. Click on the Note Text to enter text about the note. Click the Save Icon in the top-right corner to save the note. On the left side, click on a previous note to bring it back up. Click the Plus Sign in the top-right corner to start a new note.
